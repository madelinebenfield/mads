        <div id="information"> Immortalize started as a project for my Core Interaction class at Parsons
            School of Design. The prompt for this project was just to make an archive. It could be open-ended, close ended, continuous, short, and we only had to use
            minimum of 30 'images' or 'items'. I wanted to make mine collaborative and open-ended so that the archive could grow. I have a difficult time initially conceptualizing a project,
            but once I find a topic and feel comfortable, I run with it. I wanted to make this archive about music in any way, and making an archive about an album that was truly special to people
            felt like the right thing to do. 
            Under every album shown on the homepage is the name/nickname, age, album, artist, and opinion of the submitter. My wish is that this little project helped give voice to 
            opinions that truly matter to people. Feel free to press the submit button above to submit your own opinions and have your favorite album immortalized :).
