    <section> <div class="blurb"> i'm madeline, im from atlanta georgia and now i live in brooklyn. my dream job would be to take photos for album covers and for bands.
      i love music and maps. i try to do something new every day to not fall into a routine because i have a very short attention span. <br />
      im studying comm design and i have a lot of opinions about everything graphic design related. my minor is urban studies because i like maps and understanding systems,
      and hopefully one day i can work for a nonprofit and help people. my favorite color is green and my favorite food is chips and salsa. </div></section>
