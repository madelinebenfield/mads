<div id="title"> SUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE </em> </p> </header> </div>   <br> <br>
  
    <p> <div id="intro">A pattern language has the structure of a network. This is explained fully in The Timeless Way of Building. However, when we use the network of a language, we always use it as a sequence, going through the patterns, moving always from the larger patterns to the smaller, always from the ones which create structures, to the ones which then embellish those structures, and then to those which embellish the embellishments. . . .
Since the language is in truth a network, there is no one sequence which perfectly captures it. But the sequence which follows, captures the broad sweep of the full network; in doing so, it follows a line, dips down, dips up again, and follows an irregular course, a little like a needle following a tapestry.
The sequence of patterns is both a summary of the language, and at the same time, an index to the patterns. If you read through the sentences which connect the groups of patterns to one another, you will get an over- view of the whole language. And once you get this overview, you will then be able to find the patterns which are relevant to your own project.
And finally, as we shall explain in the next section, this sequence of patterns is also the “base map,” from which you can make a language for your own project, by choosing the patterns which are most useful to you, and leaving them more or less in the order that you find them printed here. We begin with that part of the language which defines a town or community. These patterns can never be “de- signed” or “built” in one fell swoop—but patient piece- meal growth, designed in such a way that every individual act is always helping to create or generate these larger global patterns, will, slowly and surely, over the years, make a community that has these global patterns in it. </div>
