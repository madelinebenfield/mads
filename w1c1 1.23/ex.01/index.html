      <p> i'm madeline, <br> im from atlanta georgia and now i live in brooklyn.
        <br> my dream job would be to take photos for album covers and for bands.
        <br> i love music and i like adventuring a lot. <br> i try to do something new every day
        to not fall into a routine because i have a very short attention span. <br>
        im studying comm design and i have a lot of opinions about everything
        graphic design related. <br> my minor is urban studies because i like
        maps and understanding systems, and hopefully one day i can work for a
        nonprofit and help people. </p>
      <p> my favorite color is green and my favorite food is chips and salsa. i have
        4 dogs but i'm very allergic to animals.</p>
